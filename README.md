This repository is to speed up note taking with LaTeX. I'm still new to the LaTeX ecosystem and there may be better ways to do what I'm doing.

## Usage
```
$ sh makenotes.sh

# This should be done twice for Table of Contents to work
$ make
$ make 

# Clean up like so (pdflatex generates various intermediate files)
$ make clean
```
